            <p>We are dedicated to improving the bottom line for forward thinking health care providers.
                <br>
                Today's healthcare executives face growing financial pressures; large numbers of uninsured patients,
                higher
                co-pays and
                deductibles, lower reimbursements from insurance companies and government agencies. All of which
                contribute
                to a complex
                accounting environment that increases overhead.
                <br>
                Evergreen Account Management understands and can ease the accounts receivable burden created by changes
                in
                the way
                modern health care facilities function.
                <br>
                In theory, most business offices have a work plan that calls for the accounts to be worked at least
                every 30
                days. In
                reality, most business offices lack the time, resources and technology to handle the heavy volume
                created by
                the growth
                in small balance outpatient business as well as the increase in self pay.
                <br>
                It is not unusual for such accounts to flow directly to collection agencies, increasing bad debt and
                decreasing patient
                goodwill.
                <br>
                We offer targeted work plans that assist with these challenges.
