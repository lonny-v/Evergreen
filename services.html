            <p>Early Out Services
                <br>
                With Evergreen Account Management, you have the ability to make changes quickly and free up key employees
                to concentrate
                on more important areas of your business and increase cash flow, while simultaneously reducing overhead.
<br>
                Timely and efficient collection action is the key to keeping receivables in check and avoiding the
                unnecessary aging of
                the accounts.
<br>
                Too often, receivables are left sitting, waiting to be called and followed up on because the in-house
                staff is over
                burdened or inexperienced.
<br>
                This is the worst situation possible since receivables become more uncollectable in proportion to their
                age.

                <br>
                An Early Out program will resolve a group of accounts much faster and more efficiently than in-house
                staff.
<br>
                Payment plans can be customized to your specifications.
<br>
                Patients with serious financial situations can be handled on an individual basis and temporary plans can
                be arranged
                until their situation improves, thus keeping the account from moving into a collection status causing
                the patient more
                financial stress.
<br>
                Patients are given coupon books for convenience and are able to set up automatic and recurring payments
                with us by using
                a credit card or electronic check.
<br>
                By implementing our Early Out program, fewer accounts go to collection which yield measurable returns as
                early in the
                collection process as possible.
<br>
                Your Patients will be happy with the availability to make monthly payments and your office wont be faced
                with the
                uncomfortable and awkward situation of asking for payment.
<br>
                Below are some of the ways that our Early Out and Time Payment programs will benefit your facility:
<br>
                *All accounts, regardless of balance will be worked.
<br>
                *All calls will come to our office, so your staff can concentrate their efforts in other areas.
<br>
                *All patient statements will be sent by us, which will save you greatly on postage as well as the costs
                of statements,
                printer supplies, in addition to the cost of personnel associated with this project.
<br>
                *Patients will receive coupons in order to remind them of each payment due.
<br>
                *Past due payment plans will be followed up on in a timely manner.
<br>
                * Increase recovery through this program will mean less accounts going to collection, at a higher fee.
<br>
                Time Payment Services
<br>
                With our Time Payment services, patients are first notified by mail that there account has been referred
                to our office
                in order to help them resolve their financial responsibility to you.
<br>
                Patients are urged to contact our office to set up a suitable payment plan, which will allow them to
                resolve the debt in
                a reasonable amount of time, without it becoming a financial burden. Letters are followed up with
                telephone contacts
                until a repayment plan is negotiated.
<br>
                Missed payments are followed up with both telephone calls and reminder letters.
<br>
                If the patient defaults on their arrangement, or if there is no arrangements or response, you will be
                notified in
                writing and at that time you will have the option of recalling the accounts for further in house
                activity, or placing
                them with the collection agency of your choice.
<br>



                Account Management Services
<br>
                Our Account Management Services if for those patients which have made a pre-determined payment
                arrangement with your
                office. We send your patient the payment coupon book and follow up on missed payments as in the same
                manner as described
                above. This service is a great way to manage those patients who send in sporadic payments who just need
                someone to
                remind them.
<br>


                In every hospital, clinic and physicians office, there will be patients who ignore your attempts to
                recover the amount
                due and those who move away or need to be pursued further. In the event that collection action is
                necessary, Utah
                Billing and Recovery Services is the collection agency who will take your bad debt accounts and offer a
                stronger
                approach. We have a highly skilled skip-tracing team who will access up to date tools, to help locate
                those who have
                skipped out and verify assets once they are found.
                In the event legal action is necessary, our legal team has over 30 years experience in collecting legal
                accounts.
